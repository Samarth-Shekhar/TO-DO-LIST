# TO-DO-LIST

I have created a straightforward and efficient to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web-based tool helps you keep track of your tasks and stay organized with an intuitive interface. Easily add, edit, and delete tasks to manage your daily activities. It's perfect for personal use and a great project for learning basic web development.
